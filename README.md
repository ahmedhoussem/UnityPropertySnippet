# UnityPropertySnippet
Just a small snippet to add to Visual Studio that i use to save some time when creating properties :)

# How to add to Visual Studio
- Put the propu.snippet file in the folder : " [Visual Studio Path]\VC#\Snippets\1033\Visual C# "
- Restart Visual Studio and go to "Tools/Code Snippets Manager ..."
- Click "Import" and select the "propu.snipet file for the "Visual C#" folder
- Done

Now writing "propu" and pressing tab should look like this

(PS : After you're done press Ctr + M + M to close the #region ;D )
